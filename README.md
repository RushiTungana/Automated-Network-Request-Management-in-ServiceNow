# Automated Network Request Management in ServiceNow

## Project Overview
This project automates network-related service requests in an organization using the ServiceNow platform. Users can submit requests such as new connections, relocations, and device registrations through a self-service portal.

The system uses dynamic forms to capture detailed information, automated approval workflows for authorization, and task assignment for fulfillment. Integration with network automation tools reduces manual work. Real-time updates and email notifications keep users informed.

A centralized database stores all records, enabling reporting on request volume, resolution times, and SLA adherence. Automation improves efficiency, reduces errors, enhances transparency, and scales network request management across IT environments.
